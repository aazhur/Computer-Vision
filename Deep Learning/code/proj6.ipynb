As you can see in the docs (https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/alexnet.py) and in the model printout above, AlexNet has 2 parts: 'features', which constists of conv layers that extract feature maps from the image, and 'classifier' which consists of FC layers that classify the features. We want to replace the last Linear layer in model.classifier. "
